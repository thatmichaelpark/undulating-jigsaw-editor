# undulating-jigsaw-editor

This is an editor for the [Undulating Jigsaw Puzzles](https://github.com/thatmichaelpark/undulating-jigsaw-puzzle).
It enables the user to edit or delete users and puzzles, or create new puzzles.

## Technologies used

This is a desktop app built with Angular and Electron.

## Biggest challenge

To showcase the fact that it is a desktop app, the program uses native OS menus
and also accesses the local file system (to list the available images). These features
required a different approach than the usual web application.
